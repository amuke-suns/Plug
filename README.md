# plug

Plug aims to bridge the gap between student business owners and their customers within the OAU community. It provides business owners with an online catalogue to showcase their products and services and easy access to a virtual market place for customers, without the hassles of signing up and logging in.
Finding the right product or service provider could be daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Adding items to cart and a last minute “you have to be logged in” notification? Payment issues? The list of problems could go on and on. Getting your business out there is even harder, especially in a community this large. It’s not uncommon to upgrade to a business account on your favourite messaging apps but that even, still brings its own problems.
Plug is your one stop solution. Customers get to see products and services they are interested in from around the community and even more, student vendors and local business owners get an accessible platform to showcase their businesses with assured productivity as Plug is tailored to their student target market. Customers no longer have to spend extra or make do with mediocre services as there are numerous vendor options to explore - other customer reviews help point you in the right direction.
